Chapter 9.
I can't get my addToCart function to work. I don't know what is wrong with it.
What does the viewbag do again?
What is the NavigationViewComponent doing?
What is a viewModel?
How do partial views fit in? I feel like I understand the html and views part alright. It's the back end of how did my data show up there part.
What is the best way to change data? In the Models.cs part or the controller? Topsy had a setImage in the Model part. The controller in cartController was messing with the Cartline.
What is model binding?
Also, I did look up lambda expressions and have a solid idea of what those are. Seeing them isnt scary.

Ch.8
I tried to map everything together. I ge tthat the page view model is a controller to view. I don't understand how Everything is connected to the SeedData.cs.
What are partial views? How does the _Layout connect it all together?
What is the AddTransient<> Do? 
Tag helpers are confusing? Are they able to pass data around?
Overall, mapping everything together is tricky. What comes from where. How it got there. And all. For example, the constructors in the controller, when are they called and made? What invokes the constructors for the models?
