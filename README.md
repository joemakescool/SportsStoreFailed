I tried to map everything together. I ge tthat the page view model is a controller to view. I don't understand how Everything is connected to the SeedData.cs.
What are partial views? How does the _Layout connect it all together?
What is the AddTransient<> Do? 
Tag helpers are confusing? Are they able to pass data around?
Overall, mapping everything together is tricky. What comes from where. How it got there. And all. For example, the constructors in the controller, when are they called and made? What invokes the constructors for the models?
